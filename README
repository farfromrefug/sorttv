SortTV
~~~~~~
Automatically sorts TV show episodes into an organised directory structure. 
	dir structure:[show]/[season x]/[eps]

Sorts and moves episodes and complete season directories.

Tested on Linux and Windows

- Optional integration with xbmc (notification and library update).
- Can optionally move non-episodes into a separate directory. 
- Can also rename episodes.
- Options for renaming, including custom naming formats and fetching episode names from thetvdb.com.
- Sort by move, copy, or symlink.
- Many other options (see below).

This provides the magic required to have your home theatre PC (HTPC) keep itself sorted out. 
You can combine this script with an automatic episode downloader (there are many available*), 
and this script can sort all of your new episodes, renaming them appropriately if you like.
Then, if you use xbmc as a front end, it can tell xbmc to check for the new episodes and 
display a message to anyone viewing, that new episodes are available.

All you will have to do is sit back and enjoy.

* Episodes of many openly licenced shows are available, and episodes can be downloaded using 
RSS feeds, torrent downloaders, file hosting site downloaders etc.

Install

You need to install Perl and then save sorttv.pl wherever. Eg: on Linux into /home/[yourusername]/sorttv/

Edit the sorttv.conf file to the settings you want (at minimum specify the location of the directories to sort from and to)

Install the modules the script uses.
To do so, run this command on Linux:
sudo cpan File::Copy::Recursive File::Glob LWP::Simple TVDB::API Text::Capitalize
On Windows run the same command, without "sudo"

---
Automation

If you want to make it sort new episodes every hour:

On Linux: 
  in a console type: crontab -e
  on a new line enter "5 * * * * " followed by the command to run the script.
  This will run the script 5 mins past every hour.
  Eg:
  5 * * * * nice perl /home/cliffe/sorttv/sorttv.pl

  Every hour this would sort new episodes according to the configuration in /home/cliffe/sorttv/sorttv.conf

On Windows:
  Create a .bat file with the command and use scheduler.
  Google is your friend.

USAGE:

sorttv.pl [OPTIONS] [directory-to-sort directory-to-sort-into]

By default SortTV tries to read the configuration from sorttv.conf
	(an example config file is available online)

The simplest way to use SortTV is to edit the example config file, then just run "perl sorttv.pl" to do the sorting

You can overwrite any config options with commandline arguments, which match the format of the config file (except that each argument starts with "--")

OPTIONS:
	--directory-to-sort:dir
		A directory containing files to sort
		For example, set this to where completed downloads are stored

	--directory-to-sort-into:dir
		Where to sort episodes into (dir that will contain dirs for each show)
		This directory will contain the structure (Show)/(Seasons)/(episodes)
		Alternatively set this to "KEEP_IN_SAME_DIRECTORIES" for a recursive renaming of files in directory-to-sort

	--non-episode-dir:dir
		Where to put things that are not episodes
		If this is supplied then files and directories that SortTV does not believe are episodes will be moved here
		If not specified, non-episodes are not moved

	--xbmc-web-server:host:port
		host:port for xbmc webserver, to automatically update library when new episodes arrive
		Remember to enable the webserver within xbmc, and "set the content" of your TV directory in xbmc.
		If not specified, xbmc is not updated

	--log-file:filepath
		Log to this file
		If not specified, output only goes to stdout (the screen)

	--verbose:[TRUE|FALSE]
		Output verbosity. Set to TRUE to show messages describing the decision making process.
		If not specified, FALSE

	--read-config-file:filepath
		Secondary config file, overwrites settings loaded so far
		If not specified, only the default config file is loaded (sorttv.conf)

	--fetch-show-title:[TRUE|FALSE]
		Fetch show titles from thetvdb.com (for proper formatting)
		If not specified, TRUE

	--rename-episodes:[TRUE|FALSE]
		Rename episodes to "show name S01E01.ext" format when moving
		If not specified, FALSE

	--rename-format:{formatstring}
		the format to use if renaming to a new format (as specified above)
		Hint: including the Episode Title as part of the name slows the process down a bit since titles are retrieved from thetvdb.com
		The formatstring can be made up of:
			[SHOW_NAME]: "My Show"
			[EP1]: "S01E01"
			[EP2]: "1x1"
			[EP3]: "1x01"
			[EP_NAME1] " - Episode Title"
			[EP_NAME2] ".Episode Title"
		If not specified the format is, "[SHOW_NAME] - [EP1][EP_NAME1]"
		For example:
			for "My Show S01E01 - Episode Title" (this is the default)
			--rename-format:[SHOW_NAME] - [EP1][EP_NAME1]
			for "My Show.S01E01.Episode Title"
			--rename-format:[SHOW_NAME].[EP1][EP_NAME2]

	--use-dots-instead-of-spaces:[TRUE|FALSE]
		Renames episodes to replace spaces with dots
		If not specified, FALSE

	--season-title:string
		Season title
		Note: if you want a space it needs to be included
		(eg "Season " -> "Season 1",  "Series "->"Series 1", "Season."->"Season.1")
		If not specified, "Season "

	--season-double-digits:[TRUE|FALSE]
		Season format padded to double digits (eg "Season 01" rather than "Season 1")
		If not specified, FALSE

	--match-type:[NORMAL|LIBERAL]
		Match type. 
		LIBERAL assumes all files are episodes and tries to extract season and episode number any way possible.
		If not specified, NORMAL

	--match-files-named-showname-episodetitle:[TRUE|FALSE]
		Attempt to sort files that are named after the show and episode title.
		For example, "My show - My episode title.avi" could become "My Show - S01E01 - My episode title.avi"
		Attempts to lookup the season and episode number based on the episodes in thetvdb.com database.
		Since this involves downloading the list of episodes from the Internet, this will cause a slower sort.
		If not specified, FALSE


	--sort-by:[MOVE|COPY|MOVE-AND-LEAVE-SYMLINK-BEHIND|PLACE-SYMLINK]
		Sort by moving or copying the file. If the file already exists because it was already copied it is silently skipped.
		The MOVE-AND-LEAVE-SYMLINK-BEHIND option may be handy if you want to continue to seed after sorting, this leaves a symlink in place of the newly moved file.
		PLACE-SYMLINK does not move the original file, but places a symlink in the sort-to directory (probably not what you want).
		If not specified, MOVE

	--treat-directories:[AS_FILES_TO_SORT|RECURSIVELY_SORT_CONTENTS|IGNORE]
		How to treat directories. 
		AS_FILES_TO_SORT - sorts directories, moving entire directories that represents an episode, also detects and moves directories of entire seasons
		RECURSIVELY_SORT_CONTENTS - doesn't move directories, just their contents, including subdirectories
		IGNORE - ignores directories
		If not specified, RECURSIVELY_SORT_CONTENTS

	--require-show-directories-already-exist:[TRUE|FALSE]
		Only sort into show directories that already exist
		This may be helpful if you have multiple destination directories. Just set up all the other details in the conf file, 
		and specify the destination directory when invoking the script. Only episodes that match existing directories in the destination will be moved.
		If this is false, then new directories are created for shows that dont have a directory.
		TRUE/FALSE
		If not specified, FALSE

	--remove-symlinks:[TRUE|FALSE]
		Deletes symlinks from the directory to sort while sorting.
		This may be helpful if you want to remove all the symlinks you previously left behind using --sort-by:MOVE-AND-LEAVE-SYMLINK-BEHIND
		You could schedule "perl sorttv.pl --remove-symlinks:TRUE" to remove these once a week/month
		If this option is enabled and used at the same time as --sort-by:MOVE-AND-LEAVE-SYMLINK-BEHIND, 
		 then only the previous links will be removed, and new ones may also be created
		If not specified, FALSE

	--show-name-substitute:NAME1-->NAME2
		Substitutes files equal to NAME1 for NAME2
		This argument can be repeated to add multiple rules for substitution

	--tvdb-id-substitute:NAME1-->ID
		Use these thetvdb.com IDs to lookup these shows
		This argument can be repeated to add multiple rules for substitution

	--force-windows-compatible-filenames:[TRUE|FALSE]
		Forces MSWindows compatible file names, even when run on other platforms such as Linux
		This may be helpful if you are writing to a Windows share from a Linux system
		If not specified, TRUE

	--lookup-language:[en|...]
		Set language for thetvdb lookups, this effects episode titles etc
		Valid values include: it, zh, es, hu, nl, pl, sl, da, de, el, he, sv, eng, fi, no, fr, ru, cs, en, ja, hr, tr, ko, pt
		If not specified, en (English)

	--fetch-images:[NEW_SHOWS|FALSE]
		Download images for shows, seasons, and episodes from thetvdb
		Downloaded images are copied into the sort-to (destination) directory.
		NEW_SHOWS - When new shows, seasons, or episodes are created the associated images are downloaded
		FALSE - No images are downloaded
		if not specified, NEW_SHOWS
	
	--images-format:POSTER
		Sets the image format to use, poster or banner.
		POSTER/BANNER
		if not specified, POSTER

	--no-network
		Disables all the network enabled features such as:
			Disables notifying xbmc
			Disables tvdb title formatting
			Disables fetching images
			Disables looking up files named "Show - EpTitle.ext"
			Changes rename format (if applicable) to not include episode titles

EXAMPLES:
Does a sort, as configured in sorttv.conf:
	perl sorttv.pl

The directory-to-sort and directory-to-sort-to can be supplied directly:
To sort a Downloads directory contents into a TV directory
	perl sorttv.pl /home/me/Downloads /home/me/Videos/TV
Alternatively:
	perl sorttv.pl --directory-to-sort:/home/me/Downloads --directory-to-sort-into:/home/me/Videos/TV

To move non-episode files in a separate directory:
	perl sorttv.pl --directory-to-sort:/home/me/Downloads --directory-to-sort-into:/home/me/Videos/TV --non-episode-dir:/home/me/Videos/Non-episodes

To integrate with xbmc (notification and automatic library update):
	perl sorttv.pl --directory-to-sort:/home/me/Downloads --directory-to-sort-into:/home/me/Videos/TV --xbmc-webserver:localhost:8080

And so on...
